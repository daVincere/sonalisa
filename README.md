A small project for MHacks Nano 2017 and for a very lalli person.

This is a stupid wallpaper creator. 

It takes your text, and overlays it on a wallpaper which matches the mood of the text.

How it does this?

1. Text is processed at the backend.

2. Polarity of the text is found out. 

3. Another function takes some wallpapers and finds their polarity.

4. Text is then overlaid to the wallpaper with the most close polarity.

5. fin.
